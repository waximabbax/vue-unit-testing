# Vue 3 Jest Unit Testing

Welcome to the Vue 3 Jest Unit Testing repository! This project is all about testing Vue 3 applications using Jest. Below, you'll find everything you need to set up and run tests for your Vue 3 project.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```git clone https://github.com/waximabbax/vue-unit-testing```


3. Navigate to the project directory:
```cd vue-unit-testing```

4. Install project dependencies:

```npm install```

## Development Server

You can run the development server with hot-reloading using the following command:

```npm run serve```

This will start a local development server, and your Vue 3 application will be available at http://localhost:8080.

## Production Build

To create a production-ready build of your Vue 3 application, use the following command:

```npm run build```

This will generate optimized and minified files in the dist directory.

## Running Unit Tests

Unit testing is essential for ensuring the reliability of your Vue 3 application. Run your unit tests with Jest using the following command:

```npm run test:unit```

## Customization

You can customize the configuration of your Vue 3 project by referring to the [Vue CLI Configuration Reference]. This reference provides detailed information on how to configure various aspects of your project, including plugins, build options, and more.

Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance this project to suit your needs. Happy coding!
